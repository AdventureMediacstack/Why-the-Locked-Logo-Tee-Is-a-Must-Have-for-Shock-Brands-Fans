                    <p dir="ltr"><span>At </span><span>Locked Offroad</span><span>, we’re known for pushing boundaries in performance suspension systems and now, we’re taking that same commitment to quality and identity into our everyday gear. Our </span><a href="https://www.lockedoffroad.com/collections/apparel-stickers/products/locked-logo-tee"><span>Locked Logo Tee</span><span> </span></a><span>isn’t just a t-shirt it’s a statement. Whether you’re already running our high-performance shocks or just starting to explore the best in off-road innovation, this tee is designed to rep the brand that backs your build. It's clean, comfortable, and built for people like us who live for the trail, the garage, and everything in between.</span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>We’re proud to offer apparel that reflects the same values we put into our core suspension products: durability, quality, and style that doesn’t quit. This tee isn’t for sitting on the sidelines, it's made for those who dig deep in the dirt, tune their setups for perfection, and represent the off-road lifestyle with pride. It’s a way to wear what you believe in, wherever your wheels take you. Whether you’re heading to a race, wrenching in the driveway, or meeting up with other builders, the Locked Logo Tee belongs in your lineup.</span></p>
                    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Product Information</span></h2>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>The </span><span>Locked Logo Tee</span><span> is our go-to shirt for everyday wear, shop days, or post-trail hangs. Made from a high-quality cotton/poly blend, it offers the soft feel of your favorite broken-in shirt, with enough durability to handle regular wear and washes. The front features our bold Locked logo subtle enough to match any fit, but strong enough to stand out among other gearheads and off-roaders.</span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>It’s available in multiple sizes to fit a variety of body types, and the fabric is pre-shrunk to minimize changes after the first wash. Whether you’re wrenching in the garage or heading to a meet-up, this shirt keeps you comfortable while showing exactly where your loyalty lies.</span></p>
                    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Why This Tee Stands Out</span></h2>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>We designed this tee because we needed it ourselves. Like many of you, we don’t just build trucks, we live and breathe this culture. From the trails to the track, our gear should represent that.</span></p>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>This isn’t a cheaply printed shirt you’ll find at a pop-up booth. This is apparel that carries the same attention to detail as our shock systems. Clean stitching, quality fabric, bold logo placement it’s all part of the experience. We believe that wearing the brand means something, and that’s why we made sure this shirt would reflect the pride we take in what we do.</span></p>
                    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What You Get</span></h2>
                    <p dir="ltr"><span>When you pick up the </span><span>Locked Logo Tee</span><span>, you’re getting:</span></p>
